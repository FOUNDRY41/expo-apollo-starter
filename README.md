# A mobile app starter kit using expo + apollo


# TODO

- eslint-config-expo or eslint-config-universe???
- do we want a src file? Or keep components, constants, navigation and screens at the top level?
- setup apollo-client 2.0
- setup onboarding, auth, and home navigators
- make it agnostic to using meteor accounts? That's cool as it would be more useful to more people, but may not give us (using meteor) a major head start on projects.
- add redux or use the [new apollo stuff](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/the-future-of-state-management-dd410864cae2)?
